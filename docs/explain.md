# What is palace?
**palace** is a memory training tool that aims to help people strengthen their memory using the method of loci, it's named palace because another name for the method of loci is a 'memory palace'
## What is the method of loci?
The method of loci is a memory technique that takes advantage of the human brains phenomenal spatial recall skills to remember arbitrary data. The method tasks the user to create an environment in their mind that they know very well and place _mnemonic devices_ along a route in that environment to help recall something. There's no limit to what someone can use the method to recall, be it a sequence of numbers like pi to 100 places, a paragraph of your favourite book (or multiple paragraphs or hypothetically the entire thing if your abilities improve) or merely a shopping list.
### What is a mnemonic image?
A mnemonic image is simply an object that triggers some sort of memory, a deck of playing cards could resemble the number 52, or even better your friend (who's birthday you never used to be able to remember) dressed as a lord of the rings character for Halloween, but they're wearing 5 rings, weird right? (Their birthday is October 5th).
## What is the goal of palace?
The goal is to get you (the user) to understand that for the most part the way you've tried to remember things has likely been less than optimal, which is okay, these soft skills weren't taught to us in schools but you're doing your part now by choosing to be an active learner. I want to show you that you're no stranger to memory techniques. Ever heard of the acronym: Never Eat Shredded Wheat (North, East, South, West). I personally haven't taken a music class or even though about music notation in almost 10 years and I can still remember which notes map to which lines on sheet music through the methods of "sing-song" and "acronyms" and I bet you have used these methods too to remember the order of the planets in the solar system and other arbitrary things. If you stick with me I'll teach you how you can use the method of loci, those prior tools and hopefully some new ones to remember whatever you want.
## Can I have an example?
Of course! Let's use an example data set to help illustrate the power of this memory tool, a shopping list:

  1. Eggs
  2. Beans
  3. Bread
  4. Onions
  5. Cabbage
  6. Orange Juice
  7. Peanut Butter
  8. Chocolate Ice Cream 
  9. Chicken
  10. Lemons

Now, most people would go about memorising this list by repeating the items in order in their head until they feel like they can recite them (the naive approach). This works to a degree and the more you do it the better you will become, however it is definitely not scalable, you might be able to use that method with this shopping list but that method quickly breaks down when the data size increases, a shopping list with 20-30 items, good luck with that. However what if I told you that you have the ability to recall a shopping list with over 100 items on it perfectly? That's where the method of loci comes in. To create your memory palace simply think of a place in the world you know well like your bedroom, your office at work, your school campus or your entire home (the more familiar you are with the space the better). For the sake of this example I'll stick to two rooms; a bedroom and kitchen. After creating the memory palace and placing the mnemonic devices in distinct locations, the last step is to make a story/tour of the palace.<br/>

  E.g. I woke up and smelt breakfast waiting for me on my nightstand, I look over and there's a breakfast sandwich, green eggs, baked beans, onions and toast, but the toast it burn to a crisp so I don't eat it, instead I go to the kitchen and open my fridge but there's nothing but cabbage everywhere, I should've gone to the shop at the beginning of the week, I go back to my room and OJ Simpson is eating the burnt sandwich I left on my nightstand, he looks like hes enjoying it. I go back to the kitchen and look in the pantry to see if there's anything remotely salvageable in there, I see a full jar of jam, but no peanut butter, I can't have my favourite sandwich that's annoying, I turn right and someone's left some chocolate ice cream in the pantry, it's completely melted!! I walk back into my room wanting to get back into my bed and sleep off this confusing day but suddenly OJ comes running out of my room screaming as if he's being chased, in close pursuit a chicken with blades on the end of it's feathers bolting toward him, OJ's faster though, he played football after all, until he unfortunately slips on a lemon squeezing it all over the floor, the chicken catches up to him and stabs him in the eye.<br/>

  That's it, that's my memory palace. I hope you've noticed the loose continuity and wacky details, for instance why is OJ (orange juice) Simpson in my house, why do I not seem to react at that, who the hell puts chocolate ice cream in a pantry, why is there a live chicken in my house and why does it have weapons on it? All of these weird details make for a fun story and more importantly a memorable one. There has to be some sort of continuity or else you won't remember the cause and effect that makes the story/tour flow as it does and there has to be some weird (even outrageous) details to make the story memorable, for example when I said my fridge was full of nothing but cabbage I meant it, I imagined me opening my fridge to wall of green, cabbage damn near falling out of the fridge. It's these details that allow you to remember things for prolonged periods of time. I bet if I asked you 30 minutes from now you'd still be able to recall the shopping list, the better and faster you get at creating palaces the longer you'll be able to remember them
## I have a phone, why should I bother?
This practice isn't due to necessity, you're quite right, computer and modern day technology make it so we quite frankly don't have to use our brains as much as we used to. However, does that mean we shouldn't? Your brain quite literally is a muscle, the less you lose it the less effective it becomes at doing tasks. Like how increased fibre consumption helps reduce all cause physiological mortality, brain usage decreases risk of mental illness that typically shows at advanced ages.
