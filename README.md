# palace 🏰

_Palace is a personal memory training tool that helps users build and strengthen their memory through the method of loci. It guides users in constructing their own memory palaces, creating vivid mnemonic images, and practicing recall through structured exercises. The goal is to make remembering — and learning how to remember — a daily ritual._
